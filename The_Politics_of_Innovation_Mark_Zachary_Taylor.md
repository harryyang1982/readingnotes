# Main Ideas

### Main Argument

1. Cardwell의 법칙은 여전히 유효하다. 과학기술 강대국은 다양한 조건에서 변화하고 움직인다.
2. 'Institution and Policy Rules'는 틀린 주장이다. 그것들은 'tools'에 가깝다. causal factor는 아님.
3. Social Network, Clusters, Standards 역시 5 Pillars와 함께 고려해야 할 변수임. 역시 tools에 가까움. how countries innovate는 설명할 수 있지만, why countries innovate는 설명하지 못함.
4. 5 Pillars: Property Rights (mainly IPR), Research and Development Subsidies, Education, Research Universities and Trade Policy

### How to measure black box?

### PE arguments

1. NIS : there are a lot of thesis looking for success of single countries but none of failures. So the solutions cannot reach 'general NIS model'. Variables added and added. 
2. VoC : There are too many exceptions.
3. Democracy : Not strong to explain.
4. Political Decentralization : Not strong.

### How Nations Succeed

1. Social Networks
2. Clusters
3. Standards

### Why Nations Fail

- Domestic losers left by Technological Innovation push congress to obstruct innovation.
- Politics matter. Politics should incentify and prioritize innovation and compensate losers.
- If domestic distribution matters, countries need 'external threats'.

### Creative Insecurity

- External threats make country innovated.

#### Market Failure vs Network Failure

- Market failure occured by market players and Network failure occured the inability of state.
- If a country want to facility innovation, (s)he has to invest infrastructure which facilitates 'social networks'.

## Summary

### Elite club

> This elite club includes the United States, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Sweden, Korea, Israel, and less than a dozen others. Yet, several of these countries did not innovate much back in 1945. (3)

### Cardwell's Law

> While Cardwell recognized the inevitable rise and fall of nations in S&T performance across time and space, neither he nor anyone else has yet been able to fully explain these differences in national capabilities. This void in our understanding is so important that it bears repeating: *no one has yet been able to explain why some countries succeed at S&T while others fail, or why national S&T success tends not to last long*. (4)

> In sum, institutions, policies, and networks (both domestic and international) together help to explain *how* nations innovate, while a country's net balance of security concerns helps to explain *why* countries innovate (or not). (5)
>
> Saudi Arabia now boasts of one of the most technologically advanced militaries in the world, replete with modern fighter jets, tactical radar, battle tanks, and cruise missles. Of course, all of these technologies were produced by American or European defense firms. Wealthy Argentines proudly sport the latest smart phones, luxury cars, and laptop computers. All are imported. (42)

#### 앓는 소리

> Although the Internet bubble provided a brief hiatus, the US deterioration in S&T appears to have accelerated in the early twenty-first century. The relative downturn has now become so severe that even an infamously gridlocked Congress has begun to act. (10)

### Creative Insecurity

> Creative insecurity is the condition of feeling more threatened by external hazards than by domestic rivals. *It is the positive difference between the threats of economic or military competition from abroad and the dangers of political-economic rivalries at home*. (13)
>
> A far smarter strategy is to identify the real long-run competitive and security threats, such as energy efficiency, climate change, aging, and diseas. This book will argue that war and the garrison state are not necessary for S&T leadership. (21)

#### 정치학자의 관점

"Again, the main lesson here is that just having "good" institutions and policies is not enough; you have to get the politics right." (19)



### Measuring the Black box

> The point is that identifying and measuring innovation is much more difficult than it sounds. Innovation does deliver *objective*, physical improvements. But evaluating these improvements can depend on *subjective* human judgments and time-sensitive actions. (36)

> *national innovation rates are often measured using thchnology patens, per capita, weighted by forward citations, granted during a specified time period*. (38)

### China is not important

> The stereotype of a Chinese S&T dragon is also contradicted by reports from inside the "Middle Kingdom," especially outside of Beijing or Shanghai. Studies of Chinese industry repeatedly show that the Chinese do not invent breakthrough technologies themselves. Instead, they create highly efficient workshops for manufacturing *other* countries' innovations. (55)
>
> In sum, Chinese innovation is currently typified by short-term, low-risk improvements to production or distribution processes, or incremental improvements to foreign products. This has resulted in fantastic economic growth, but the Chinese do not yet create much cutting-edge S&T. (57)

### How do Nations Innovate?

#### Market driven view

> *a market is characterzied by a large number of informed, rational individuals involved in the free exchange of goods, services, and capital, resulting in economic efficiency and innovation.* (72)

#### The role of govenment for innovation(74)

* Define and enfoce property rights
* Maximize freedom of exchange, consumption, and production
* Improve the quality and quantity of information available to market actors
* Prevent a small number of actors from eliminating competition
* Provide those goods and services that private markets do not provide more efficiently (also known as "public goods")
* Ensure that investors, producers, and consumers each bear the costs, and capture the benefits, of their own activities
* Reduce the costs of market participation (e.g., lower transaction costs, solve coordination dilemmas)

#### Pillar One: Property Rights (questions on Kenneth Arrow)

> Arrow's solution was simple. First, government must create property rights in S&T knowledge; then, government must support markets for trading these property rights. In other words, to fix the market failure in inventive activity, government needs to make this vital S&T knowledge hard to copy and difficult to share *without* the owner's permission. (76)
>
> In the worst cases of abuse, some businesses are created solely to exploit these flaws in the patent system and contribute little or no innovation whatsoever. For example, a business might seek the most fuzzy and flexible claims possible on its invention to scare off potential competitors. Firms can also use legal techniques to keep claims hidden or to addend them over time, thus further obfuscating and confusing the boundaries on intellectual property. (78)
>
> (…) critics now warn that Arrow's simplistic model of patents may no longer apply in certain twenty-first-century high-tech sectors. This warning applies to less patentable inventions made in software and biotechnology, and to the even more abstract innovations that now typify computerized business practices, clinical medicine, and mathematical and statistcal analyses. These areas of knowledge are often too abstract to clearly define. (80)

#### Pillar Two: Research and Development Subsidies

> First, merely increasing R&D expenditures does not necessarily cause high levels technological change. R&D money is just as easily misspent or misappropriated as any other type of government largess. (86)
>
> Another problem with R&D subsidies is that costs can be purposely inflated by private investors to win support for government funding. (87)

#### Pillar Three: Education

> During the 1700s and 1800s, this generally meant technology replacing expensive skilled labor. During the twentieth century, however, technological change increased the demand for skilled workers to use it. (89) 노동자를 쫓아내다가 이제는 숙련 노동자를 찾게 된다.

#### Pillar Four: Research Universities

> The rise of racist fascism in Europe during the 1930s drove into American universities a deluge of top scientists and engineers, including such leading lights as Albert Einstein (architect of modern physics), Max Delbruck (father of molecular biology), and Leo Szilard (creator of the electron microscope and cyclotron). (95)
>
> Certainly California's Silicon Valley and Boston's Route 128 both have several top-ranked research universities in their midst, with regional businesses acting to commercialize the science and technology coming out of academic laboratories. Such university-based commercial regions have been viewed as critical to national S&T competitiveness. Yet, simlar university-based high-technology regions failed to appear around top research universities located in Atlanta, New Haven, or Ann Arbor. Nor have attempts to export the Silicon Valley model typically been quite so successful in countries such as Mexico, China, and South Korea. (96)
>
> To pay these exorbitant costs, universities have increasingly turned to private industry. As of 2010, private investors funded an average of 5.8% (or $3.1 billion) of all academic research, and up to 25% in some fields, such as biotechnology. But to earn a return on its investment, private industry often requires ownership of the intellectual property rights that come out of it. (97)

#### Pillar Five: Trade Policy

> After the 1970s, enthusiasm for protectionism was gradually replaced with support for export-led growth strategies. The main idea behind export-led strategies is for a developing country to use its comparative advantage in cheap but well-educated and well-disciplined labor to become a base for manufacturing high-tech goods. (101)
>
> However, of all the Five Pillars, trade policy seems to have the weakest correlation with any of the innovation measures in any time period. Perhaps the strongest relationship between trade and innovation can be found during the 1970s. Yet, even during this period, statistical analysis reveals that trade openness explains only around 15% of the variation in national innovation rates. (102)

### Why Nations Fail

#### NIS

> The first NIS scholars wanted to address what they described as the feebleness of general innovation theory and the "hyped and rather haphazard" innovation research and policy of the time. Ironically, (..) no general theory of national innovation rates. (109)
>
> Thus, after almost thirty years of research, NIS scholars have yet to produce any general hypotheses to explain differences in national innovation rates. That is, while they have achieved their empirical goal of increasing the set of data points and potential relationships between them, NIS scholars have yet to fit a theory to them. (111) 데이터만 무성하며, 그 데이터들은 모조리 overfitting

#### Varieties of Capitalism

> VoC posits that the more a national allows markets to structure its domestic economic relationships, the more radically innovative its economic actors will be. Conversely, the more a nation chooses to coordinate economic relationships via non market mechanisms, the more slowly and incrementally innovative its economic actors will be. (111)
>
> The central claims of VoC theory focus on how a nation's macro-institutional environment determines the conduct of these crucial relationships, and thus how economic actors organize to solve the classic coordination problems that afflict such relations. (112)

* LMEs: Liberal Market Economies —> Radical Innovation
* CMEs: Coordinated Market Economies —> Incremental Innovation
* MMEs: Mediterranean Market Economies

> VoC scholars argue that this combination of institutions results in long employment tenures, corporate strategies based on product differentiation rather than intense product competition, and formal training systems for employees that focus on high skills and a mix of company-specific and industry-specific skills-in other words, the very factors that combine to folster incremental innovation. (114)

**이직 문제**

> Fluid labor markets and short job tenures motivate workers to pursue selfish career goals and to acquire mobile general skills rather than firm-specific or industry-specific skills. (115)

> It appears that the success of VoC theory strongly depends on the inclusion of the United States as an LME. (115)
>
> there exist no strong general differences in innovation rates between the different VoC country types. (116)
>
> LMEs are strongest in chemistry, physics, biomedical research, and math. CMEs are strongest in chemistry, engineering, physics, and biology. (117)

#### Democracy

> Recently, these arguments have been further developed by growth economists such as Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James Robinson. They identify competitive democracy as *the* fundamental institutional requirement for long-run national economic success, including S&T performance. (124)
>
> They are called "inclusive institutions" because they allow and encourage widespread participation in the economy. They therefore foster the investment, mobility, efficiency, and creative destruction necessary for innovation. (125) Democracy is supposedly the most effective form of pluralrism. (126)
>
> Democratic countries will therefore have a broadly inclusive political process, generally resulting in inclusive economic institutions. Inventors and entrepreneurs will be given the incentives and freedoms to succeed, while inefficient or obsolete firms and industries will be free to fail. (126)
>
> We find the opposite: democracy appears to hurt S&T production, even over the course of forty years. Yet, given the mostly cross-shaped scatterplot, perhaps the most honest interpretation of the data is that democracy does not have a strong relationship with S&T performance. (127)

#### Political Decentralization

> This can occur in two directions, either vertically or horizontally. Vertical decentralization simply means federalism: political power is shared between the central government and local governments (state, county, and city). Horizontal decentralization means checks and balances between the different branches of government. (128)

**Delaware effect**

> Delaware has been famously successful at using low taxes and easy regulations to attract business investment, resulting in an outsized number of corporate headquarters located there. In academic circles, this concept has become known as "market-preserving federalism," which holds that the political competition bred by federalism prevents government from acting in a predatory manner toward innovators. (130)

**Japan**

> Japan's subnational governments were composed of a mix of elected and appointed officials with only a small degree of local autonomy over fiscal and policy matters. At the national level, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Finance famously managed the economy. (137)

**South Korea & Singapore**

> both Taiwan and South Korea democratized *after* their surge in innovation rates had begun, not before, while innovative Singapore remains today only marginally democratic, and each of these governments continues to intervene heavily into markets. (138)

> Like a carpenter's tools, institutions and policies do *influence* outcomes, but they are *not* causal forces. Good tools do not make someone an expert carpenter; good institutions and policies do not compel a society to innovate. (139)



### How Nations Succeed

#### Social Networks

> Social networks provide vital information that neither markets nor governments easily capture. This includes essential information about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) labor; investment opportunities; and markets for highly specialized S&T inputs and outputs. (…) In capturing and distributing information cheaply, social networks help S&T actors to find one another and to increase their flexibility to rapid change. In so doing, networks drastically reduce the high costs and risks of innovation. (141)

#### Clusters

> Clusters are a particular form of network that reduces costs, creates complementarities, and increases spillovers within a concentrated geographic area. (141)

* 셰필드형(알프레드 마샬): 숙련 노동확보, 시장 창출, 기술진보가 자연스레 벌어짐. (경공업형)
* 미국형(크루그먼): 공급/수요 차원에서 규모의 경제 확보.
* 찬물: 이직이 자유로울 때에만 정보교류가 쉬움. DEC는 수직통합, 중앙집권적이었으며 충성심 강요. 비밀주의, 경직됨, 자체충족적...
* BT, 생활과학 등에는 맞지만 자동차에는 잘 맞지 않음.

##### Triple Helix: 대학, 산업, 정부 (학연산) (164)

#### Standards

> Standards help to determind how large a network can get and how well its members can interoperate. (141)

##### Case Studies 1: Israel (H/W & S/W)

- 무기체계, 핵 연구, 컴퓨터 분야
- 국가 기반 벤처 캐피털 운영
- 이스라엘 벤처 캐피털들이 SF나 NY에 가서 유대계 실리콘 밸리 / 월가 투자자들과 조인트 벤처 수립
- 유럽과 구 공산권 유대인 STEM 노동자들의 유입

##### Case Studies 2: Taiwan (H/W)

* Industrial Technology Research Institution (ITRI) 수립 —> Computer Hardware
* 미국과 유럽 테크 섹터 투자자들과 꽌시를 맺음. 'personal networks'
* 미국계 화교 S&T 전문가들과 교류진행. --> 타이완에 정기적인 기술 자문.

##### Case Studies 3: Ireland (S/W)

* Industrial Development Authority (IDA) 수립
* STEM 펀딩 규모가 작음. 사회과학 중심.
* 국가가 자신의 역할ㅇ르 '수출 주선자' 정도로 줄임.
* 더블린이 다양한 방식으로 창업이나 마케팅/경영/경제인 협회 창설 등을 지원하나 여전히 미미.
* 자체 개발보다는 MNCs 유치하는 데 최적화. (저렴한 부동산)
* 아일랜드 기업 네트워크는 특화보다는 현상 유지 수준으로 진행.. 폭은 넓고 깊이는 떨어짐. less aggressive.

##### Case Studies 4: Mexico (Failure)

- 자생적인 high-tech 기업이 없음
- 국가는 그저 기업이 알아서 기술을 이전하겠거니 정도로 수수방관
- 기술전수 없는 하청공장화

##### Case studies 5: 두개의 한국

* 북조선: 폐쇄적 네트워크
* 대한민국: 개방적. 미국 / 일본에서 지식전수.

### Technological Losers and Political Resistance to Innovation

#### types of losers

- economic losers / social losers / cultural losers / political losers

### Creative Insecurity

> External economic and military threats constitute a force that can counteract the domestic distributional politics that cause S&T stagnation. (216)
>
> Creative insecurity theory posits two opposing dynamics that affect national innovation rates: **domestic rivalries versus external threats**. (224)
>
> The domestic losers must be convinced, compensated, or coerced to accept their fate. (225)
>
> Creative insecurity theory asserts that the key to explaining national innovation rates is not asking *which* institutions or policies a country should use, but what are the politics *behind* a country's pursuit of innovation. (225)

#### Role of Country

> Yet, solving market failure is only half a strategy; governments must act also to address network failure. (..) This might mean building the kinds of comprehensive, high-quality, physical infrastructure upon which social networks are based, especially transportation and communication networks. (284)
>
> Governments can direct to their particular supporters subsidies for R&D laboratories, research universities, procurement programs for new technological systems, and protection for infant industries. (286).

#### Make Life, Not War

> My argument here is not that farming S&T in security terms is foolish; it is that we must be wary of abuses. (291)
>
> Rather than manufacture false security concerns, I argue that we should instead broaden our concept of security. Policymakers and politicians should focus on the very real, nonstate, external threats their citizens face. For example, climate change poses a catastophic risk for all American everywhere. The already-present danger of droughts, floods, rising sea levels, and major weather events should scare us enough to motivate massive investment in innovations in fusion, solar, wind, and other noncarbon energy sources. (292)
