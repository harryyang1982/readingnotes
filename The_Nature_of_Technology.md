## 1. Questions

#### Evolution in Technology

> The other is the process by which all objects of some class are related by ties of common descent from the collection of earlier objects. This is evolution in its full sense, and it is what I will mean by evolution. (15)
>
> In other words, if we could understand evolution, we could understand that most mysterious of processes:innovation. (15)

#### Combinatorial Evolution

> Technologies inherit parts from the technologies that preceded them, so putting such parts together--combining them-- must have a great deal to do with how technologies come into being. This makes the abrupt appearance of radically novel technologies suddenly seem much less abrupt. Technologies somehow must come into being as fresh combinations of what already exists. (19)
>
> combination drove change--or at least the innovation of technology. (20)
>
> If new technologies are indeed combinations of previous ones, then the stock of existing technologies must somehow provide the parts for combination. So the very cumulation of earlier technologies begets further cumulation. (20)
>
> I will call this mechanism evolution by combination, or more succinctly, *combinatorial evolution*. (22)
>
> Technology builds out not just from combination of what exists already but from the constant capturing and harnessing of natural phenomena. (22)

#### The Themes of the Book

> 1. Individual technologies are constructed or put together--combined--from components or assemblies or subsystems at hand. 
> 2. Each Component of technology is itself in miniature a technology. 
> 3. All Technologies harness and exploit some effect or phenomenon, usually several. (23)
>
> Technology, once a means of production, is becoming a chemistry. (25)



## 2. Combination and Structure

#### definition

> 1. *a means to fulfill a human purpose*. : a device, or method, or process. *functionality*
> 2. technology as an *assemblage of practices and components*. 
> 3. the entire *collection of devices and engineering practices available to a culture*. (28)
>
> an instance of a specific device or method or as the *idea* of that device or method. (31)

#### architecture

> Together these various modules and their connections from a working *architecture*. To understand a technology means to understand its principle, and how this translates into a working architecture. (35)
>
> Combination must work not just by brining together a purpose with a concept or principle that matches it. It must provide a main set of assemblies or modules to execute this central idea. It must support this with further assemblies, and these again with further assemblies to support these. And all these parts and assemblies must be orchestrated to perform together harmoniously. Combination must necessarily be a highly disciplined process. (43)

#### modularity

> Simon's point is that grouping parts into assemblies gives better protection against unexpected shocks, more ease of construction, and more ease of repair. (36)
>
> Partitioning technologies into grouping or modules corresponds to "chunking" in cognitive psychology. (36)
>
> Technologies, in other words, have a recursive structure. They consist of technologies within technologies all the way down to the elemental parts. (38)

#### view of technology

> "In the wild" - meaninig in the real world-a technology rarely is fixed. It constantly changes its architecture, adapts and reconfigures as purposes change and improvements occur. (41)



## 3. Phenomena

#### Definition of Phenomean 

> Phenomena are simply natural effects, and as such they exist independently of humans and of technology. They have no "use" attached to them. A principle by contrast is the *idea of use of a phenomenon for some purpose* and it exists very much in the world of humans and of use. (49)
>
> In practice, before phenomena can be used for a technology, they must be harnessed and set up to work properly. (..) They may have to be coaxed and tuned to operate satisfactorily, and they may work only in a narrow range of conditions. (49)
>
> The subsystems used to render a phenomenon usable for a specific purpose are technologies, and they rely on their own phenomena. (50)
>
> Nearly always it is necessary to set up these phenomena and separate them by allocating them to separate modules. (50)

#### The Essence of Technology

> A technology is a phenomenon captured and put to use. (50)
>
> All these phenomena--scores of them--are captured, encapsulated in a myriad of devices, and replicated, some many thousands of times in as many thousands of identical components. (52)
>
> The technology becomes a complex of interactive processes--a complex of captured phenomena--supporting each other, using each other, "conversing" with each other, "calling" each other much as subroutines in computer programs call each other. (52-53)
>
> It is a programming of phenomena for a purpose. A technology is an orchestration of phenomena to our use. (53)

#### Purposed Systems

> the logic of technology would apply to much wider class of things than the devices and methods I have been talking about, and that would greatly enlarge the scope of our argument. (55)
>
> ex) monetary system : based on trust

#### Capturing Phenomena

> The discovery of the most deeply hidden phenomena (..) require a cumulation of knowledge and modern techniques to reveal themselves. They require modern methods of discovery and recovery--they require, in other words, modern science. (57)

#### Technology and Science

> Technologists use science because that is the only way we understand how phenomena at the deeper layers work. (60-61)
>
> They exploit them day-to-day without much awareness of the details of their origin. (..) It is better to say it builds both from science and from its own experience. These two cumulate together, and as this happens science organically becomes part of technology. Science is deeply woven into technology. (61)
>
> It is possible to imagine science without technology. (..) Science without technology would be a weak science. It would be little more than the thought-based science of the Greeks. (64)
>
> Technology builds from harnessing phenomena largely uncovered by science. And equally science builds from technology--or, better to say, forms from its technologies(..). Science and technology co-evolve in a symbiotic relationship. (64)
>
> The two cannot be separated, they rely completely on one another. Science is necessary to uncover and understand deeply buried phenomena, and technology is necessary to advance science. (64-65)

## 4. Domains, or Worlds Entered for What Can Be Accomplished There

#### Definition of domains

> Sometimes elements cluster because they share a common theory. (..) I will call such clusters--such bodies of technology--*domains*. A domain will be any cluster of components drawn from in order to form devices or methods, along with its collection of practices and knowledge, its rules of combination, and its associated way of thinking. (70)
>
> A technology (individual, that is) does a job; it achieves a purpose--often a very particular purpose. A domain (technology-plural) does no job; it merely exists as a toolbox of useful components to be drawn from, a set of practices to be used. (71)
>
> Where technology possesses a hierarchy of assemblies, subassemblies, and components; domains possesses subdomains, and within these still further sub-subdomains. (71)

#### Domaining

> Any technology of significant size is put together from several domains. (72)
>
> The significant ones are new domainings. They are the expressing of a given purpose in a different set of components, as when the provision of power changed from being expressed in waterwheel technology to being expressed in steam technology. (73)

#### Mastery in a technology

> A domain forms a language; and a new technological artifact constructed from ccomponents of the domain is an utterance in the domain's language. (76)
>
> And just as utterances in a language must be put together according to the rules of that language, so must design be architected according to the rules of allowable combination in a domains. (76)
>
> Grammars in large part reflect our understanding of how nature works in a particular domain.  But this understanding comes not just from theory. It comes also from practical prescriptions that accumulate with experience. (77)
>
> **a fluency in the vocabulary of components used; a familiarity with standard modules, previous designs, standard materials, fastening technologies;** (78)
>
> there are varying degrees of fluence, of articulateness, of self-expression. (..) Mastery in a technology in fact is difficult to achieve because a technology grammar, unlike a linguistic one, changes rapidly. (79)
>
> If they are expert they are so familiar with their world that they can combine operations and envisage the outcome almost automatically. (80)

## 5. Engineering and Its Solutions

#### Novel Technology

> that novelty, as we will see, comes in several forms: new solutions within given technologies, novel technologies themselves, new bodies of technology, and new elements added to the collective of technology. (90)

#### Standard Engineering

> *standard engineering* is the carrying out of a new project, the putting together of methods and devices under principles that are known and accepted. (91)
>
> **Design** procedes from an overalll concept, to the detailed design of the assemblies and parts that will accomplish this, to their manufacture or construction. (91)
>
> Even when a concept is selected it must be translated into assemblies and working components, many of which will have to be specially designed. (92)
>
> Early versions may show unexpected glitches: they may not work as expected; they may not work at all; or they may use more weight or energy or cost than visualized. And so, fixes must be sought in the shape of better solutions or materials. And because assemblies must mutually balance so that everythin works properly together, unexpected deficiencies in one assembly must be offset by adjustments in others. A design is a set of compromises. (93)
>
> even with computer-assisted design and manufacture, human input is still important. Getting things to work requires decisions that cannot be left to a machine. Designers must exercise judgment on concepts, architectures, and materials; and on appropriate strengths, ratings, and capacities. And matching all these at the many levels of a project requires human coordination. (94)

#### Engineering as Problem Solving

> Engineering and problem solving go hand in hand for a more systemic reason. (..) a new design project, is only called for if some aspect of the technology needs to be different. (95)
>
> Whichever the case, a new design project is undertaken only when something different must be designed for. (95)
>
> *a new project always poses a new problem*. (95)
>
> intention comes first and the means to fulfill it--the appropriate combination of components--fall in behind it. Design is expression. (98)
>
> All these cumulate to push an existing technology and its domain forward. In this way, experience with different solutions and subsolutions steadily cumulates and technologies change and improve over time. The result is innovation. (101)
>
> Standard engineering *learns*. (101)

#### Solutions Becoming Building Blocks

> New solutions do not come about by incremental step-by-step changes, as biological changes are forced to. They are combinations that can be put together instantly and they come out of purposeful problem solving. (102-103)
>
> It is enough to say that technologies (or solutions) that gain prevalence tend to gain further advantage and to lock in, so there is a positive feedback process at work in the "selection" of technologies. (103)
>
> The useful solutions build up and diffuse among practitioners. And some go on become elements or building blocks that can be used in further technologies. Standard engineering contributes much to both innovation and evolution. (105) 

## 6. The Origin of Technologies

> they do not explain *how* a new technology comes into being any more than pointing to suitable soil explains how a seed comes to germinate. (108)
>
> From what process then --from what source--do the devices and methods and products that form the economy originate? (108)

#### What Qualifies as a Novel Technology?

> I will define a radically new technology as one that uses a principle new or different to the purpose in hand. A principle, remember, is the method of something's operation, the base way in which something works. (108)
>
> We can think of invention as the process that puts this chain together. It is a process that continues until each problem and subproblem resolves itself into one that can be physically dealt with--until the chain is fully in place. (110)
>
> whatever its variations, invention falls into two broad patterns. It may start from one end of the chain, from a given purpose or need, and find a principle to accomplish this. Or, it may start from the other end, from a phenomenon or effect, usually a newly discovered one, and envisage in it some principle of use. (110)

#### Finding a Base Principle

> the need arises not from an outside stimulus, but from within technology itself. (111)
>
> The continuous thinking allows the subconscious to work, possibly to recall an effect or concept from past experience, and it provides a subconscious alertness so that when a candidate principle or a different way to define the problem suggests itself the whisper at the door is heard. (112)
>
> Each candidate principle, when considered seriously, brings up its own particular difficulties, which pose new conceptual subproblems. (112)
>
> The process is in part recusrive and the whole becomes a concatenation of parts, a combination of stretches. (113)
>
> They are never invented from nothing. At the creative heart of invention lies appropriation, some sort of mental borrowing that comes in the form of a half-conscious suggestion. (115)
>
> Just as a composer has in mind a main theme but must orchestrate the parts that will express it, so must the originator orchestrate the working parts that will express the main concept. (116)

#### Embodying the Concept in Physical Form

> Bringing the concept to full reality means that a detailed architecture must be worked out (116)
>
> Bringing what has largely been an idea to reality raises a number of challenges that may have been mentally foreseen but now must be physically dealt with. Solutions are proposed--and fail; parts do not work; redesigns are necessary; tests must be made. This second phase of invention consists mostly in finding working solutions to challenging subproblems, and it has a great deal of the character of standard engineering. (117)

#### Invention Proceeding from a Phenomenon

> where invention proceeds from a phenomenon. (..) This pattern is again a linking of an effect in use with a purpose, but now the process starts from the other end--the effect one. Typically someone notices an effect, or posits in theoretically, and this suggests an idea of use--a principle. (119)

#### What Lies at the Heart of Invention?

> When originators need a certain function they can associate back to a principle that produced a corresponding one in a field they know about. At the core of this mechanism--call it *principle transfer*--is seeking an analogy. This is another form of mental association. (122)
>
> What is common to originators is not "genius" or special powers. (..) It is the possession of a very large quiver of functionalities and principles. (..) 
>
> Originators, however, do not merely master functionalities and use them once and finally in their great creation. What always precedes invention is a lengthy period of accumulating functionalities and of experimenting with them on small problems as five-finger exercises. (123)

#### The Pyramid of Casuality

> the fact that all inventions are supported by a pyramid of causality means that an invention tends to show up when the pieces necessary for it, and the need for it, fall into place. (125)

#### Invention in Science and Mathematics

> we can certainly say that in putting the parts together as explanatory functionalities, he had got a theory upon which to work.
>
> (..)
>
> Origination in scientific theorizing, as in technology, is at bottom a linking --a linking of the observational givens of a problem with a principle (a conceptual insight) that roughly suggests these, and eventually with a complete set of principles that reproduces these. (128)

#### Invention and Novel Building Blocks

> how novel technologies arise. The mechanism is certainly not Darwinian; novel species in technology do not arise from the accumulation of small changes. (129)
>
> whatever their particular histories, at bottom all inventions share the same mechanism: all link a purpose with a principle that will fulfill it, and all must translate that principle into working parts. (130)

### Three ways how novelbuilding blocks arise

> as solutions to standard engineering problems; as nondeliberate inventions; or as inventions proper, radically novel solutions that use new principles. Whichever the case, all arise from the combination of existing technologies. (130)

## 7. Structural Deepening

> Something more than pure variation and selection must be going on. Let us look afresh at the development process and see what this is. (132)

#### Internal Replacement

> Developers can overcome limitations often simply by replacing the impeded component--itself a sub technology--by one that works better. (133)
>
> most of materials science is about seeking improvements in phenomena by understanding the properties of materials that produce these. (133)
>
> we need to think of a technology as an object--more an organism, really--that develops through its constituent parts and subparts improving simultaneously at all levels in its hierarchy. (134)

#### Structural Deepening

> Another mechanism of development is at work. I will call it *structural deepening*. (134)
>
> By adding subsystems to work around such limitations, technologies elaborate as they evolve. They add "depth" or design sophistication to their structures. 
>
> They become more *complex*. (135)
>
> Limitations can arise with any of these. So we can say that to overcome limits, a technology will add subsystems or assemblies that (a) enhance its basic performance, (b) allow it to monitor and react to changed or exceptional circumstances, (c) adapt it to a wider range of tasks, and (d) enhance its safety and reliability. (135)
>
> Performance improves at all levels of the system, and at all levels the technology's structure becomes more complicated. (135)

#### Lock-in and Adaptive Stretch

> The technology reaches maturity. If further advancement is sought, a novel principle is needed. But novel principles cannot be counted on to arrive when needed. Even when they do, they may not easily replace the old one. The old design, the old principle, tends to be locked in. (138)
>
> The greater the distance between a novel solution and the accepted one, the larger is this lock-in to previous tradition. (..) The new is delayed by the very success of the old, making changeover in technologies neither easy nor smooth. (140)
>
> When a new circumstance comes along or a demand for a different sphere of application arrives, it is easier to reach for the old technology--the old base principle--and adapt it by "stretching" it to cover the new circumstances. (140)
>
> taking the standard components of the old technology and reconfiguring them for the new purpose, or adding further assemblies to them to achieve the new purpose. (140)
>
> At some point of development, the old principle becomes ever more difficult to stretch. The way is now open for a novel principle to get a footing. (..) And the new principle begins to elaborate. (141)

## 8. Revolutions and Redomainings

> The domain and the economy mutually coadapt and mutually create the new. 
>
> It is this process of mutual change and mutual creation that we call a revolution. (155)

#### Time in the Economy

> A revolution does not fully arrive until we organize our activities around its technologies, and until these technologies adapt themselves to us. For this to happen, the new domain must gather adherents and prestige. (157)
>
> these processes of structural change do not just *take* time in the economy, they *define* time in the economy. (158)
>
> By the same principle, if structures changed, if things in the universe were to move and alter themselves, "time" would emerge. (158)

#### Innovation and National Competitiveness

> Why should bodies of technology concentrate in particular locations and not spread themselves evenly over many places? (159)
>
> I do not want to play knowledge down. You cannot advance nanotechnology without detailed knowledge of chemistry and quantum physics. But advanced technology depends on more than knowledge--facts, truths, ideas, and information. (159)
>
> Real advanced technology issues not from knowledge but from something I will call *deep craft*. **Deep craft** is more than knowledge. It is a set of knowledge.(159)
>
> Such knowings root themselves in local micro-cultures. They become highly concentrated in particular localities. (160)
>
> They take time to build up, and do not transfer easily to other places. And they cannot be fully written down. Formal versions of the craft do find their way eventually into technical papers and textbooks. But the real expertise resides largely where it was created, taken for granted, shared, and unspoken. (161)
>
> Other locations can contribute, to be sure. They can manifacture and improve the technology, but they will not be initiating it on a large scale because the detailed knowings needed to push the edge are not resident there. (161)

#### Silicon Valley

> The region around Stanford University known as Silicon Valley started in wireless telegraphy around 1910, parlayed that into electronics in the 1930s and 40s, seeded a great deal of the computer industry, and has now turned to biotechnology and nanotechnology. As new domains spin off from old ones or sprout from university research, so can a region build upon them. (162)

#### Naive thinking

> if a country wants to lead in advanced technology, it needs to do more than invest in industrial parks or vaguely foster "innovation." It needs to build its basic science without any stated purpose of commercial use. And it needs to culture that science in a stable setting with funding and encouragement, let the science sow itself commercially in small startup companies, allow these nascent ventures to grow and sprout with minimal interference, and allow this science and its commercial applications to seed new revolutions. (162)

#### Innovation

> Innovation is not something mysterious. Certainly it is not a matter of vaguely invoking something called "creativity." Innovation is simply the acoomplishing of the tasks of the economy by other means. (164)
>
> innovation has two main themes. One is this constant finding or putting together of new solutions out of existing toolboxes of piece and practices. Thhe other is industries constantly combining their practices and processes with functionalities drawn from newly arriving toolboxes--new domains. (..) The result is new processes and arrangements, new ways of doing things, not just in one area of application but all across the economy. (164)

## 9. The Mechanisms of Evolution

**self-producing vs combining**

#### Opportunity Niches

> *opportunities* for technologies--niches they could usefully occupy. The presence of opportunity niches calls novel technologies into existence. (174)
>
> Further, when basic needs are fulfilled and society reaches some degree of prosperity, these "needs" begin to differentiate in an almost vascular expansion. (175)
>
> The vast majority of niches for technology are created not from human needs, but from the needs of technologies themselves. (175)
>
> Opportunity niches change as the collective of technology changes; and they elaborate and grow in numbers as the collective grows. (176)

#### The Core Mechanism

> collective as a network that builds upon itself and organically grows outward. In this network each technology (I will usually call it an element) is represented by a point or node. Each node has links (directed arrows) pointing to it from its parent nodes, the technologies that made it possible. (..) We can imagine the elements or nodes that *are* active to be lit up. I will call these the *active collection* of technologies. (177)
>
> Mediating all this is the economy. We can think of it as a system that determines costs and prices and therefore signals opportunities to be fulfilled by novel elements, as well as deciding which candidate technologies will enter the active collection. (177)
>
> Here is another possibility. A new element may cause not just the collapse of the technology it replaces(step 2), but also the collapse of technologies that depend on the replaced technology's needs (step 4). (..) it is a chain of domino-like collapses--*avalanches* of destruction, if you prefer to call them that. (180)

#### Evolution Mechanism

> 1. The novel technology enters the active collection as a novel element. It becomes a new node in the active collection.
> 2. The novel element becomes available to replace existing technologies and components in existing technologies.
> 3. The novel element sets up further "needs" or opportunity niches for supporting technologies and organizational arrangements.
> 4. If old displaced technologies fade from the collective, *their* ancillary needs are dropped. The opportunity niches they provide disappear with them, and the elements that in turn fill these may become inactive.
> 5. The novel element becomes available as a potential component in further technologies--further elements.
> 6. The economy--the pattern of goods and services produced and consumed--readjusts to these steps. Costs and prices (and therefore incentives for novel technologies) change accordingly. (178-179)

#### An Experiment in Evolution

> we might be able to confine ourselves to some restricted world of technologies, some world that would evolve on a computer we could study. (182)
>
> The purpose of our computer experiment was to see if the system could evolve technologies--logic circuits--by combination from existing ones to fulfill niches on the list, and to study this evolution as it happens. (183)

#### A Different Form of Evolution?

> the evolution or unfolding of the collective is historically contingent. (..) small differences do not average out over time. (..) the sequence and timing of their appearance would be different. And as a consequence, economic and social history would be different. (186)
>
> just as the collection of biological species in the far future is not predictable from the current collection, the collective of technology in the economic future is not predictable. (186)
>
> now we can barely predict the shape of technology fifty years ahead. (186)
>
> In technology, combinations are the norm. (..) Darwinian variation and selection are by no means absent, but they follow behind, working on structures already formed. (188)
>
> technology is not merely a catalog of individual parts. It is a metabolic chemistry. (189)
>
> does the entity reproduce, grow, respond and adapt to its environment, and take in and give out energy to maintain its being? Technology (again the collective) also passes these tests. (189) 

## 10. The Economy Evolving as Its Technologies Evolve

#### The Economy as an Expression of Its Technologies

> the economy becomes something like a gigatanic container for its technologies, a huge machine with many modules or parts that are its technologies--its means of production. (192)
>
> I will define the economy as *the set of arrangements and activities by which a society satisfies its needs*. (..) arrangements are "means of production" (..) 
>
> I want to go beyond Marx's mills and machinery. The set of arrangements that form the economy include all the myriad devices and methods and all the purposed systems we call technologies. (192)
>
> we begin to see the economy not as container for its technologies, but as something constructed from its technologies. The economy is a set of activities and behaviors and flows of goods and services mediated by--draped over--its technologies. (193) The economy is an expression of its technologies. (193)
>
> The economy forms an ecology for its technologies, it forms out of them, and this means it does not exist separately. (193)
>
> Only when we observe over decades do we see the arrangements and processes that form the economy coming into being, interacting, and collapsing back again. (194)

#### Structural Change

> the addition of new technologies setting in motion a train of changes to the structure of the economy, to the set of arrangements around which the economy forms. (194)
>
> Technology determines the structure of the economy and thereby much of the world that emerges from this, but which technologies fall into place is not determined in advance. (199)

#### Problems as the Answer to Solutions

> (The coming of novel technologies) sets up a train of technological accommodations and of new problems, and in so doing it creates new opportunity niches that call forth fresh combinations which in turn introduce yet further technologies--and further problems. (199)
>
> The result is not just Schumpeter's disturbance of equilibrium, but a constant roiling of simultaneous changes, all overlapping and interacting and triggering further change. The result is change begetting change. (200)
>
> This could only happen if no novel phenomena in the future were to be uncovered; or if the possibilities for further combinations were somehow exhausted. (200)
>
> Arrangements are built one upon another: the commercial parts of the legal system are constructed on the assumption that markets and contracts exist; and markets and contracts assume that banking and investment mechanisms exist. The economy therefore is not a homogeneous thing. (201)
>
> These underlying base "laws" always stay the same. But the means by which they are expressed change over time, and the patterns they form change and re-form over time. (202)
>
> our interpretations of the economy must change constantly over time. (202)
>
> We can indeed observe the economy, but our language for it, our labels for it, and our understanding of it are all frozen by the great flares that have lit up the scene, and in particular by the last great set of flares. (202)

## 11. Where Do We Stand with This Creation of Ours?

#### Technology Becoming Biology--and Vice Versa

> So how can technologies be becoming more biological?
>
> One is that all technologies are in a sense simultaneously mechanistic and organic. (207)
>
> If you examine it mentally from the bottom up, however, from how these parts are put together, you see these as integral parts--integral organs--forming a higher, functioning, purposed whole. It becomes a functioning body--it becomes organic. (..) The other answer is purely biological: technologies are acquiring properties we associate with living organisms. (..) The more sophiscated and "high-tech" technologies become, the more they become biological. We are beginning to appreciate that technology is as much metabolism as mechanism. (208)
>
> Conceptually at least, biology is becoming technology. And physically, technology is becoming biology. The two are starting to close on each other, and indeed as we move deeper into genomics and nanotechnology, more than this, they are starting to intermingle. (208)

#### The Generative Economy

> Entrepreneurship in advanced technology is not merely a matter of decision making. It is a matter of imposing a cognitive order on situations that are repeatedly ill-defined. Technology thinker John Seely Brown tells us that "management has shifted from making product to making sense."(210)
>
> In the management of businesses, from optimizing production processes to creating new combinations--new products, new functionalities. From rationality to sense-making; from commodity based companies to skill-based companies; from the purchase of components to the formation of alliances; from steady-state operations to constant adaptation. (210)
>
> Where the old economy was a machine, the new one is a chemistry, always creating itself in new combinations, always discovering, always in process. (211)

#### Pure Order Versus Messy Vitality

> But in time all these domains sprawled beyond any system built to contain them, and all thorough the twentieth century movements based on the mechanistic dreams of pure order broke down. (212)

#### Where Do We Stand with Technology?

> Technology, as I have said, is the programming of nature, the orchestration and use of nature's phenomena. So in its deepest essence it is natural, profoundly natural. But it does not *feel* natural. (215)
>
> If you look at the heroes, they have technology as well. But their technology is different. It is not hidden and dehumanizing; their starships are rickety and organic and have to be kicked to get running. This is crucial. Their technology is human. It is an extension of their natures, fallible, human, individual, and therefore beneficent. They have not traded their humanness for technology, nor surrendered their will to technology. Technology has surrendered to *them*. (216)
>
> our unconscious makes a distinction between technology as enslaving our nature versus technology as extending our nature. This is the correct distinction. (..) Where technology separates us rom these it brings a type of death. But where it enhances these, it affirms life. It affirms our humanness. (216)
