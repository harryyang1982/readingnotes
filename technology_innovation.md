#### CoPS: Complex Products and systems

- 인접분야: 혁신연구, 산업사회학, 소프트웨어공학, 프로젝트 관리, 시스템 공학, 군사연구, 기술사

#### Features

- 고비용, 주문형 상품, 혁신의 동학, 산업 조정의 본성이 기존의 대량생산 상품과 다름
- one-off projects(small batches)
- emphasis of product is on design, project management, systems engineering and systems integration
- multi-firm ex-ante agreement and negotiation on technical issues through the stages of design, development and manufature

#### Examples

- telecommunications exchange, flight simulators, aircraft engines, avionics systems, train engines, air traffic control units, systems for electricity grids, **offshore oil equipment**, intelligent building and cellular phone network equipment

#### Innovation condition

- combination of **technological, regulatory and market changes**

#### Two types of innovation model

- Conventional innovation model
- propsed CoPS scheme

#### CoPS Definition

- high cost, engineering-intensive products, systems, networks and constructs

#### Projects Multi-firm involved

- supplied by a unit of production, be it a single firm, a production unit or a temporary project-based organization involving many firms
- 부품, 네트워크 구조, 통제 메커니즘 ▶︎ common goal
- a temporary coalition of organizations which usually cuts across the boundaries of single supplier firms.

#### CoPS process (think of EPCIC)

- pre-production bidding, conceptual and detailed design, fabrication, delivery and installation, post-production innovation, maintenance, servicing and sometimes, de-commissioning

**'a project is a project is a project.'**

### Hierarchy as a feature of CoPS

- production involves the integration of disparate technologies, usually entailing large scale project management and extensive antional and international cooperation between enterprises. **Pyramid**

#### High technology

- exclude low-technology goods and most medium-technology goods, regardless of cost

### Complexity

- Complexity contribute to difficulties of managing production and innovation by adding uncertainty and risk.

### Product architectures

- The quanitity and possible alternative system architectures and pose significant coordination problems for CoPS suppliers, especially when system integrators, users and regulators have to agree ex-ante on the path of innovation.
- the option of internally coordinating all the required capabilities within one firm may be unavailable due to inadequate managerial span of control. 밖에서만 모르는 거

### Design paths and feedback loops

- focusing devices and needed to cope with the danger of 'combinatorial explosion'. 
- under conditions of rapid technological change, unclear user requirements and multiple, customised components.
- **FEEDBACK LOOPS**: substantial feedback loops from later to earlier production stages which require alterations to overall system architectures or to the design of specifi components. 공정을 위해선 후행에서 선행으로 실질적인 피드백을 주는 것이 중요.
- **technical coordination across firms** is an essential part of managing innovation, regardless of product type. 회사간 기술적 조정이 필수.

#### Breadth of knowledge and skills 

- variety of distinct knowledge and skill
- dictate that they work closely with specialist firms to produce the final system. 
- project completion depends critically on knowledge embodied in key individuals and groups, recognised for their abilities

### Coordination across units

- user's own understanding of final requirements
- the intensity of other supplier involvement can further complicate coordination difficulties. 주문주가 개입해서 감놔라 배놔라 할 수록 어려워짐.
- the degree to which the managerial span of control is outside the prime contractor's reach influences the extent to which innovation has to be negotiated between the parties corncerned. 
  - ex) NORSOK. Statoil이든 DSME든 지켜야만 한다.

### Embedded software

- given the way embedded software has transformed many CoPS.
- core integrative activity
- The coordination of embedded software within and between firms has proved to be an uncertain, risk-intensive activity.
- no sufficient evidence to argue that embedded software is a stumbling block in the execution of many large CoPS projects ▶︎ delays, cancellations and cost overruns

### Implications for experimentation

- high cost of experimentation, so impossible to build prototypes for design, production or market experimentation purposes
- the larger the project, the more the investment, experience and knowledge required at the early stages of production, including overall and detailed design
- **Mistakes at the early stage can be extremely costly and hard to rectify!**
- difficult to systematically capture and recall previous design and development experiences.
- the more important tacit knowledge is likely to be in CoPS project design and execution.
- only a handful of engineering teams capable of design and building new versions of complex products. ▶︎ 인재가 구하기 힘들다.

### CoPS vs mass production

- CoPS are the high cost, high technology goods made in projects and small batches
- for mass production, there are fewer customised components, fewer suppliers, less regulatory constraints and a small variety of knowledge and skill inputs.

#### The conventional view of innovation ####

- focuses on stages through which product and process technologies tend to pass within industries, stresses similarities in the innovation process, arguing that product and process technologies tend to follow life cycle patterns from birth to maturity
- single firm is a chief unit of analysis for competitive purposes
- the R&D lab develops and the market selects

#### A contrast with CoPS

- CoPS are never mass produced
- CoPS are made up of many customised, interconnected control units, sub-systems and component
- the degree of CoPS system hierarchy is high, architectures are complex and designs frequently tailored for specific customers and markets
  - ex) turboject engine: their parts have been from 1 to 22,000.
- With many CoPS there is a high degree of **user involvement** through which business needs feed directly into the innovation process
- the users' involvement in R&D, design, production and subsequent innovations distinguishes CoPS from simple goods
- Innovation and diffusion may overlap considerably and cannot be neatly separated, as in mass produced goods. 혁신과 확산이 겹침

### Implications for coordination and management

#### Nature of CoPS networks

- there exists a wide continuum ranging from commodity-type market transactions, to an intermediate area of linkages based on goodwill, through to complex inter-locking clusters, groups and alliances where cooperation is fully and often formally developed.
- Because high quality requires continuous feedback from users, project management, systems engineering and design involves long-lasting, close interactions between buyers and sellers.

#### Determinants of technical advance

- national preference for local suppliers, low contestability and high barriers to entry may allow poor performers to dominate particular markets
- users play a direct role in funding R&D and shaping paths of innovation : **'user push', 'demand driven' innovation**

#### The project as a coordination mechanism

- Within CoPS networks, the project is a primary form of coordination
- The Channel Tunnel entailed a massive task of financial, managerial and technological coordination involving hundreds of contractors, at least 208 lending banks and around 14,500 employees at its peak
- Major decisions needed the agreement of all major organizations, including the user, the customer and sometimes, specialist sub-contractors

#### The project-based orgnization

- Larger project-based organizations are likely to embody typical functional departments which provide technical, human and financial resources for project bidding, management, systems engineering and so on
- "those responsible for marketing had to sell, not a product, but the idea that their firm was able to produce what the customer required."
- For effiency in CoPS projects, it is likely that a responsive, step-by-step, crafted management is needed to deal with uncertainty and feedback loops. (응답적, 순차적, 세밀한 관리)
- **Much of the required knowledge is embodied in key individuals and cannot easily be codified**

#### The central role of the user

- the depth of user involvement and its influence at various stages of the innovation process is one of the critical dimensions of CoPS

#### Implication for management theory and practice

- the CoPS supplier will require particular management skills and strategies centred far more around bidding, design and development than production economies of scale as in the case of mass produced goods. The management of projects has to deal with uncertainty over emerging properties and changes in user specifications.
- Rolls Royce, British Aerospace and others is to increase the use of commercial, off-the-shelf modules, simplify production, increase the scale of output of components, realise learning economies and thereby reduce costs.
- The difficulties in capturing and sharing knowledge from one project to another may hinder routinised learning and compromise productivity improvements.  같은 일이 없기에 학습이 쉽지가 않다.
- dealing with complex scheduling and engineering tasks.
- Material Requirements Planning (MRP), statistical process control and lean production is not suitable. MRP는 CoPS에 적합하지 않음
- isolated improvements at the individual firm level can only have limited impact on project performance and competitiveness. To be more effective, the latter requires the **optimisation of the total project network**, rahter than any one supplier.
